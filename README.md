# ReactiveCocoa
ReactiveCocoa (RAC) is a framework for **composing and transforming sequences of values**.

## No seriously, what is it?
Check out the [announcement blog post](https://github.com/blog/1107-reactivecocoa-is-now-open-source) for a ton more info.

## Getting Started
RAC uses some submodules. Once you've cloned the repository, be sure to run `git submodule update --recursive --init` to pull them all down.

Then checkout the [Mac](https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa/tree/master/GHAPIDemo) or [iOS](https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa/tree/master/RACiOSDemo) demos.

## Foundation Support
There are a number of categories that provide RAC-based bridges to standard Foundation classes. They're not included as part of the framework proper in order to keep the framework size down.

You can find them in [RACExtensions](https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa/tree/master/RACExtensions). To use them, simply add them directly to your project as needed.
