 ## Signal
 
 A **signal**, represented by the [`Signal`](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/master/ReactiveCocoa/Swift/Signal.swift) type, is any series of [events](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/master/ReactiveCocoa/Swift/Event.swift)
 over time that can be observed.
 
 Signals are generally used to represent event streams that are already “in progress”,
 like notifications, user input, etc. As work is performed or data is received,
 events are _sent_ on the signal, which pushes them out to any observers.
 All observers see the events at the same time.
 
 Users must observe a signal in order to access its events.
 Observing a signal does not trigger any side effects. In other words,
 signals are entirely producer-driven and push-based, and consumers (observers)
 cannot have any effect on their lifetime. While observing a signal, the user
 can only evaluate the events in the same order as they are sent on the signal. There
 is no random access to values of a signal.
 
 Signals can be manipulated by applying [primitives](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/master/Documentation/BasicOperators.md) to them.
 Typical primitives to manipulate a single signal like `filter`, `map` and
 `reduce` are available, as well as primitives to manipulate multiple signals
 at once (`zip`). Primitives operate only on the `Next` events of a signal.
 
 The lifetime of a signal consists of any number of `Next` events, followed by
 one terminating event, which may be any one of `Failed`, `Completed`, or
 `Interrupted` (but not a combination).
 Terminating events are not included in the signal’s values—they must be
 handled specially.

/*:
 ### `Subscription`
 A Signal represents and event stream that is already "in progress", sometimes also called "hot". This means, that a subscriber may miss events that have been sent before the subscription.
 Furthermore, the subscription to a signal does not trigger any side effects
 */
scopedExample("Subscription") {
    // Signal.pipe is a way to manually control a signal. the returned observer can be used to send values to the signal
    let (signal, observer) = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()
    
    let subscriber1 = Observer<Int, NoError>(next: { print("Subscriber 1 received \($0)") } )
    let subscriber2 = Observer<Int, NoError>(next: { print("Subscriber 2 received \($0)") } )
    
    print("Subscriber 1 subscribes to the signal")
    signal.observe(subscriber1)
    
    print("Send value `10` on the signal")
    // subscriber1 will receive the value
    observer.sendNext(10)
    
    print("Subscriber 2 subscribes to the signal")
    // Notice how nothing happens at this moment, i.e. subscriber2 does not receive the previously sent value
    signal.observe(subscriber2)
    
    print("Send value `20` on the signal")
    // Notice that now, subscriber1 and subscriber2 will receive the value
    observer.sendNext(20)

 A Signal that completes immediately without emitting any value.
