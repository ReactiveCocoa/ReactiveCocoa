@interface NSObject (RACObservablePropertyObserving)

// Adds the given blocks as the callbacks for when the key path changes. Unlike
// direct KVO observation this handles deallocation of intermediate objects.
//
// The observation does not need to be explicitly removed. It will be removed
// when the observer or the receiver deallocate. The blocks can be called on
// different threads, but will not be called concurrently.
//
// observer          - The object that requested the observation.
// keyPath           - The key path to observe.
// willChangeBlock   - The block called before the value at the key path
//                     changes. It is passed whether the key path component
//                     whose value will be changed explicitly is the last one or
//                     an intermediate one.
// didChangeBlock    - The block called after the value at the key path changes.
//                     It is passed whether the key path component whose value
//                     was changed explicitly was the last one or an
//                     intermediate one, whether the change was caused by the
//                     deallocation of a value, and the new value of the key
//                     path.
//
// Returns a disposable that can be used to stop the observation.
