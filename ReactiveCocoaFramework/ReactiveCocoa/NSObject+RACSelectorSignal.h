@interface NSObject (RACSelectorSignal)

// Creates a signal associated with the receiver, which will send a tuple of the
// method's arguments each time the given selector is invoked.
//
// If the selector is already implemented on the receiver, the existing
// implementation will be invoked _before_ the signal fires.
//
// If the selector is not yet implemented on the receiver, the injected
// implementation will have a `void` return type and accept only object
// arguments. Invoking the added implementation with non-object values, or
// expecting a return value, will result in undefined behavior.
//
// This is useful for changing an event or delegate callback into a signal. For
// example, on an NSView:
//
//     [[view rac_signalForSelector:@selector(mouseDown:)] subscribeNext:^(RACTuple *args) {
//         NSEvent *event = args.first;
//         NSLog(@"mouse button pressed: %@", event);
//     }];
//
// selector - The selector for whose invocations are to be observed. If it
//            doesn't exist, it will be implemented to accept object arguments
//            and return void.
//
// Returns a signal which will send a tuple of arguments upon each invocation of
// the selector, then completes when the receiver is deallocated. `next` events
// will be sent synchronously from the thread that invoked the method. If
// a runtime call fails, the signal will send an error in the
// RACSelectorSignalErrorDomain.
- (RACSignal *)rac_signalForSelector:(SEL)selector;

// Behaves like -rac_signalForSelector:, but if the selector is not yet
// implemented on the receiver, its method signature is looked up within
// `protocol`, and may accept non-object arguments.
//
// If the selector is not yet implemented and has a return value, the injected
// method will return all zero bits (equal to `nil`, `NULL`, 0, 0.0f, etc.).
//
// selector - The selector for whose invocations are to be observed. If it
//            doesn't exist, it will be implemented using information from
//            `protocol`, and may accept non-object arguments and return
//            a value. This cannot have C arrays or unions as arguments or
//            return type.
// protocol - The protocol in which `selector` is declared. This will be used
//            for type information if the selector is not already implemented on
//            the receiver. This must not be `NULL`, and `selector` must exist
//            in this protocol.
//
// Returns a signal which will send a tuple of arguments on each invocation of
// the selector, or an error in RACSelectorSignalErrorDomain if a runtime
// call fails.
