@class RACChannelTerminal;

// A two-way channel.
//
// Conceptually, RACChannel can be thought of as a bidirectional connection,
// composed of two controllable signals that work in parallel.
//
// For example, when connecting between a view and a model:
//
//        Model                      View
//  `leadingTerminal` ------> `followingTerminal`
//  `leadingTerminal` <------ `followingTerminal`
//
// The initial value of the model and all future changes to it are _sent on_ the
// `leadingTerminal`, and _received by_ subscribers of the `followingTerminal`.
//
// Likewise, whenever the user changes the value of the view, that value is sent
// on the `followingTerminal`, and received in the model from the
// `leadingTerminal`. However, the initial value of the view is not received
// from the `leadingTerminal` (only future changes).
@interface RACChannel : NSObject

// The terminal which "leads" the channel, by sending its latest value
// immediately to new subscribers of the `followingTerminal`.
//
// New subscribers to this terminal will not receive a starting value, but will
// receive all future values that are sent to the `followingTerminal`.
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) RACChannelTerminal *leadingTerminal;

// The terminal which "follows" the lead of the other terminal, only sending
// _future_ values to the subscribers of the `leadingTerminal`.
//
// The latest value sent to the `leadingTerminal` (if any) will be sent
// immediately to new subscribers of this terminal, and then all future values
// as well.
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) RACChannelTerminal *followingTerminal;

@end

// Represents one end of a RACChannel.
//
// An terminal is similar to a socket or pipe -- it represents one end of
// a connection (the RACChannel, in this case). Values sent to this terminal
// will _not_ be received by its subscribers. Instead, the values will be sent
// to the subscribers of the RACChannel's _other_ terminal.
//
// For example, when using the `followingTerminal`, _sent_ values can only be
// _received_ from the `leadingTerminal`, and vice versa.
//
// To make it easy to terminate a RACChannel, `error` and `completed` events
// sent to either terminal will be received by the subscribers of _both_
// terminals.
//
// Do not instantiate this class directly. Create a RACChannel instead.
