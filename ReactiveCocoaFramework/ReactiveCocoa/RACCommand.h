// A command is a signal triggered in response to some action, typically
// UI-related.
@interface RACCommand : NSObject

// A signal of the signals returned by successful invocations of -execute:
// (i.e., while the receiver is `enabled`).
//
// Errors will be automatically caught upon the inner signals, and sent upon
// `errors` instead. If you _want_ to receive inner errors, use -execute: or
// -[RACSignal materialize].
// 
// Only executions that begin _after_ subscription will be sent upon this
// signal. All inner signals will arrive upon the main thread.
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) RACSignal *executionSignals;

// A signal of whether this command is currently executing.
//
// This will send YES whenever -execute: is invoked and the created signal has
// not yet terminated. Once all executions have terminated, `executing` will
// send NO.
//
// This signal will send its current value upon subscription, and then all
// future values on the main thread.
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) RACSignal *executing;

// A signal of whether this command is able to execute.
//
// This will send NO if:
//
//  - The command was created with an `enabledSignal`, and NO is sent upon that
//    signal, or
//  - `allowsConcurrentExecution` is NO and the command has started executing.
//
// Once the above conditions are no longer met, the signal will send YES.
//
// This signal will send its current value upon subscription, and then all
// future values on the main thread.
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) RACSignal *enabled;

// Forwards any errors that occur within signals returned by -execute:.
//
// When an error occurs on a signal returned from -execute:, this signal will
// send the associated NSError value as a `next` event (since an `error` event
// would terminate the stream).
//
// After subscription, this signal will send all future errors on the main
// thread.
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) RACSignal *errors;

// Whether the command allows multiple executions to proceed concurrently.
//
// The default value for this property is NO.
@property (atomic, assign) BOOL allowsConcurrentExecution;

// Invokes -initWithSignalBlock:enabled: with a nil `enabledSignal`.
- (id)initWithSignalBlock:(RACSignal * (^)(id input))signalBlock;

// Initializes a command that is conditionally enabled.
//
// This is the designated initializer for this class.
//
// enabledSignal - A signal of BOOLs which indicate whether the command should
//                 be enabled. `enabled` will be based on the latest value sent
//                 from this signal. Before any values are sent, `enabled` will
//                 default to YES. This argument may be nil.
// signalBlock   - A block which will map each input value (passed to -execute:)
//                 to a signal of work. The returned signal will be multicasted
//                 to a replay subject, sent on `executionSignals`, then
//                 subscribed to synchronously. Neither the block nor the
//                 returned signal may be nil.
- (id)initWithEnabled:(RACSignal *)enabledSignal signalBlock:(RACSignal * (^)(id input))signalBlock;

// If the receiver is enabled, this method will:
//
//  1. Invoke the `signalBlock` given at the time of initialization.
//  2. Multicast the returned signal to a RACReplaySubject.
//  3. Send the multicasted signal on `executionSignals`.
//  4. Subscribe (connect) to the original signal on the main thread.
//
// input - The input value to pass to the receiver's `signalBlock`. This may be
//         nil.
//
// Returns the multicasted signal, after subscription. If the receiver is not
// enabled, returns a signal that will send an error with code
// RACCommandErrorNotEnabled.
