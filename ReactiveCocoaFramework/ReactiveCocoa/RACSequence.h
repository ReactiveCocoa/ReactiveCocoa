// Represents an immutable sequence of values. Unless otherwise specified, the
// sequences' values are evaluated lazily on demand. Like Cocoa collections,
// sequences cannot contain nil.
//
// Most inherited RACStream methods that accept a block will execute the block
// _at most_ once for each value that is evaluated in the returned sequence.
// Side effects are subject to the behavior described in
// +sequenceWithHeadBlock:tailBlock:.
//
// Implemented as a class cluster. A minimal implementation for a subclass
// consists simply of -head and -tail.
@interface RACSequence : RACStream <NSCoding, NSCopying, NSFastEnumeration>

// The first object in the sequence, or nil if the sequence is empty.
//
// Subclasses must provide an implementation of this method.
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) id head;

// All but the first object in the sequence, or nil if the sequence is empty.
//
// Subclasses must provide an implementation of this method.
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) RACSequence *tail;

// Evaluates the full sequence to produce an equivalently-sized array.
@property (nonatomic, copy, readonly) NSArray *array;

// Returns an enumerator of all objects in the sequence.
@property (nonatomic, copy, readonly) NSEnumerator *objectEnumerator;

// Converts a sequence into an eager sequence.
//
// An eager sequence fully evaluates all of its values immediately. Sequences
// derived from an eager sequence will also be eager.
//
// Returns a new eager sequence, or the receiver if the sequence is already
// eager.
@property (nonatomic, copy, readonly) RACSequence *eagerSequence;

// Converts a sequence into a lazy sequence.
//
// A lazy sequence evaluates its values on demand, as they are accessed.
// Sequences derived from a lazy sequence will also be lazy.
//
// Returns a new lazy sequence, or the receiver if the sequence is already lazy.
@property (nonatomic, copy, readonly) RACSequence *lazySequence;

// Invokes -signalWithScheduler: with a new RACScheduler.
- (RACSignal *)signal;

// Evaluates the full sequence on the given scheduler.
//
// Each item is evaluated in its own scheduled block, such that control of the
// scheduler is yielded between each value.
//
// Returns a signal which sends the receiver's values on the given scheduler as
// they're evaluated.

// Applies a left fold to the sequence.
//
// This is the same as iterating the sequence along with a provided start value.
// This uses a constant amount of memory. A left fold is left-associative so in
// the sequence [1,2,3] the block would applied in the following order:
//  reduce(reduce(reduce(start, 1), 2), 3)
//
// start  - The starting value for the fold. Used as `accumulator` for the
//          first fold.
// reduce - The block used to combine the accumulated value and the next value.
//          Cannot be nil.
//
// Returns a reduced value.
- (id)foldLeftWithStart:(id)start reduce:(id (^)(id accumulator, id value))reduce;

// Applies a right fold to the sequence.
//
// A right fold is equivalent to recursion on the list. The block is evaluated
// from the right to the left in list. It is right associative so it's applied
// to the rightmost elements first. For example, in the sequence [1,2,3] the
// block is applied in the order:
//   reduce(1, reduce(2, reduce(3, start)))
//
// start  - The starting value for the fold.
// reduce - The block used to combine the accumulated value and the next head.
//          The block is given the accumulated value and the value of the rest
//          of the computation (result of the recursion). This is computed when
//          you retrieve its value using `rest.head`. This allows you to
//          prevent unnecessary computation by not accessing `rest.head` if you
//          don't need to.
//
// Returns a reduced value.
- (id)foldRightWithStart:(id)start reduce:(id (^)(id first, RACSequence *rest))reduce;

// Check if any value in sequence passes the block.
//
// block - The block predicate used to check each item. Cannot be nil.
//
// Returns a boolean indiciating if any value in the sequence passed.
- (BOOL)any:(BOOL (^)(id value))block;

// Check if all values in the sequence pass the block.
//
// block - The block predicate used to check each item. Cannot be nil.
//
// Returns a boolean indicating if all values in the sequence passed.
- (BOOL)all:(BOOL (^)(id value))block;

// Returns the first object that passes the block.
//
// block - The block predicate used to check each item. Cannot be nil.
//
// Returns an object that passes the block or nil if no objects passed.
- (id)objectPassingTest:(BOOL (^)(id value))block;

// Creates a sequence that dynamically generates its values.
//
// headBlock - Invoked the first time -head is accessed.
// tailBlock - Invoked the first time -tail is accessed.
//
// The results from each block are memoized, so each block will be invoked at
// most once, no matter how many times the head and tail properties of the
// sequence are accessed.
//
// Any side effects in `headBlock` or `tailBlock` should be thread-safe, since
// the sequence may be evaluated at any time from any thread. Not only that, but
// -tail may be accessed before -head, or both may be accessed simultaneously.
// As noted above, side effects will only be triggered the _first_ time -head or
// -tail is invoked.
//
// Returns a sequence that lazily invokes the given blocks to provide head and
// tail. `headBlock` must not be nil.
