/// Represents a push-driven stream of events.
/// 
/// Signals generally represent data that will be delivered in the future. As work
/// is performed or data is received, values are _sent_ on the signal, which pushes
/// them out to any subscribers. Users must subscribe to a signal, through
/// a method like -subscribeNext:error:completed:, in order to access its values.
/// 
/// Signals send three different types of events to their subscribers:
/// 
///  * The **next** event provides a new value from the stream. Unlike Cocoa
///    collections, it is completely valid for a signal to include `nil` in its
///    values.
///  * The **error** event indicates that an error occurred before the signal could
///    finish. The event may include an `NSError` object that indicates what went
///    wrong. Errors must be handled specially – they are not included in the
///    stream's values.
///  * The **completed** event indicates that the signal finished successfully, and
///    that no more values will be added to the stream. Completion must be handled
///    specially – it is not included in the stream of values.
/// 
/// The lifetime of a signal consists of any number of `next` events, followed by
/// one `error` or `completed` event (but not both).
