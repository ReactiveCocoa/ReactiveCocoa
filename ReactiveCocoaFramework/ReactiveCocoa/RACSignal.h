@interface RACSignal : RACStream

// Creates a new signal. This is the preferred way to create a new signal
// operation or behavior.
//
// Events can be sent to new subscribers immediately in the `didSubscribe`
// block, but the subscriber will not be able to dispose of the signal until
// a RACDisposable is returned from `didSubscribe`. In the case of infinite
// signals, this won't _ever_ happen if events are sent immediately.
//
// To ensure that the signal is disposable, events can be scheduled on the
// +[RACScheduler currentScheduler] (so that they're deferred, not sent
// immediately), or they can be sent in the background. The RACDisposable
// returned by the `didSubscribe` block should cancel any such scheduling or
// asynchronous work.
//
// didSubscribe - Called when the signal is subscribed to. The new subscriber is
//                passed in. You can then manually control the <RACSubscriber> by
//                sending it -sendNext:, -sendError:, and -sendCompleted,
//                as defined by the operation you're implementing. This block
//                should return a RACDisposable which cancels any ongoing work
//                triggered by the subscription, and cleans up any resources or
//                disposables created as part of it. When the disposable is
//                disposed of, the signal must not send any more events to the
//                `subscriber`. If no cleanup is necessary, return nil.
//
// **Note:** The `didSubscribe` block is called every time a new subscriber
// subscribes. Any side effects within the block will thus execute once for each
// subscription, not necessarily on one thread, and possibly even
// simultaneously!

// scheduler - The scheduler on which `block` will be scheduled and results
//             delivered. Cannot be nil.
// block     - The block to invoke. Cannot be NULL.
//
// Returns a signal which will send all events sent on the subscriber given to
// `block`. All events will be sent on `scheduler` and it will replay any missed
// events to new subscribers.

//
// Note that disposing of the subscription to the returned signal will *not*
// dispose of the underlying subscription. If you need that behavior, see
// -[RACMulticastConnection autoconnect]. The underlying subscription will never
// be disposed of. Because of this, `block` should never return an infinite
// signal since there would be no way of ending it.
//
// scheduler - The scheduler on which the block should be scheduled. Note that 
//             if given +[RACScheduler immediateScheduler], the block will be
//             invoked synchronously on the first subscription. Cannot be nil.
// block     - The block to invoke on the first subscription. Cannot be NULL.
//
// Returns a signal which will pass through the events sent to the subscriber
// given to `block` and replay any missed events to new subscribers.

@interface RACSignal (Subscription)

// Subscribes `subscriber` to changes on the receiver. The receiver defines which
// events it actually sends and in what situations the events are sent.
//
// Subscription will always happen on a valid RACScheduler. If the
// +[RACScheduler currentScheduler] cannot be determined at the time of
// subscription (e.g., because the calling code is running on a GCD queue or
// NSOperationQueue), subscription will occur on a private background scheduler.
// On the main thread, subscriptions will always occur immediately, with a
// +[RACScheduler currentScheduler] of +[RACScheduler mainThreadScheduler].
//
// Returns nil or a disposable. You can call -[RACDisposable dispose] if you
// need to end your subscription before it would "naturally" end, either by
// completing or erroring. Once the disposable has been disposed, the subscriber
// won't receive any more events from the subscription.
