// A concrete protocol representing any stream of values. Implemented by
// RACSubscribable and RACSequence.
//
// This protocol represents a monad, upon which many stream-based operations can
// be built.
//
// When conforming to this protocol in a custom class, only `@required` methods
// need to be implemented. Default implementations will automatically be
// provided for any methods marked as `@concrete`. For more information, see
// EXTConcreteProtocol.h.
@protocol RACStream <NSObject>

// Returns an empty stream.

// Lifts `value` into the stream monad.
//
// Returns a stream containing only the given value.
+ (instancetype)return:(id)value;

// Binds `block` to the values in the receiver.
//
// block - A block which accepts the values in the receiver and returns a new
//         instance of the receiver's class. If the block sets `stop` to `YES`,
//         the bind will terminate after the returned value. Returning `nil`
//         will result in immediate termination.
//
// Returns a new stream which represents the combined result of all applications
// of `block`.

// Appends the values of `stream` to the values in the receiver.
//
// stream - A stream to concatenate. This must be an instance of the same
//          concrete class as the receiver, and should not be `nil`.
//
// Returns a new stream representing the receiver followed by `stream`.

// Combines the values in `streams` using `reduceBlock`. `reduceBlock` will be
// called with the first value of each stream, then with the second value of
// each stream, and so forth until at least one of the streams is exhausted.
//
// streams       - The streams to combine. These must all be instances of the
//                 same concrete class implementing the protocol.
// reduceBlock   - The block which reduces the values from all the streams
//                 into one value. It should take as many arguments as the
//                 number of streams given. Each argument will be an object
//                 argument, wrapped as needed. If nil, the returned stream
//                 will contain a RACTuple of the values.
//
// Returns a new stream containing the return values of `reduceBlock` applied to
// the values contained in the input streams, or if `reduceBlock` is nil, tuples
// of the same values

// stream is returned.

// of `block`.
