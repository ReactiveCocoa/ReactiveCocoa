/**
 * \@onExit defines some code to be executed when the current scope exits. The
 * code must be enclosed in braces and terminated with a semicolon, and will be
 * executed regardless of how the scope is exited, including from exceptions,
 * \c goto, \c return, \c break, and \c continue.
 *
 * Provided code will go into a block to be executed later. Keep this in mind as
 * it pertains to memory management, restrictions on assignment, etc. Because
 * the code is used within a block, \c return is a legal (though perhaps
 * confusing) way to exit the cleanup block early.
 *
 * Multiple \@onExit statements in the same scope are executed in reverse
 * lexical order. This helps when pairing resource acquisition with \@onExit
 * statements, as it guarantees teardown in the opposite order of acquisition.
 *
 * @note This statement cannot be used within scopes defined without braces
 * (like a one line \c if). In practice, this is not an issue, since \@onExit is
 * a useless construct in such a case anyways.
