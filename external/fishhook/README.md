# fishhook

__fishhook__ is a very simple library that enables dynamically rebinding symbols in Mach-O binaries running on iOS in the simulator and on device. This provides functionality that is similar to using [`DYLD_INTERPOSE`][interpose] on OS X. At Facebook, we've found it useful as a way to hook calls in libSystem for debugging/tracing purposes (for example, auditing for double-close issues with file descriptors).

## Usage

Once you add `fishhook.h`/`fishhook.c` to your project, you can rebind symbols as follows:
```Objective-C
#import <dlfcn.h>

#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import "fishhook.h"
 
static int (*orig_close)(int);
static int (*orig_open)(const char *, int, ...);
 
void save_original_symbols() {
  orig_close = dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "close");
  orig_open = dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "open");
}
 
int my_close(int fd) {
  printf("Calling real close(%d)\n", fd);
  return orig_close(fd);
}
 
int my_open(const char *path, int oflag, ...) {
  va_list ap = {0};
  mode_t mode = 0;
 
  if ((oflag & O_CREAT) != 0) {
    // mode only applies to O_CREAT
    va_start(ap, oflag);
    mode = va_arg(ap, int);
    va_end(ap);
    printf("Calling real open('%s', %d, %d)\n", path, oflag, mode);
    return orig_open(path, oflag, mode);
  } else {
    printf("Calling real open('%s', %d)\n", path, oflag);
    return orig_open(path, oflag, mode);
  }
}
 
int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
  @autoreleasepool {
    save_original_symbols();
    rebind_symbols((struct rebinding[2]){{"close", my_close}, {"open", my_open}}, 2);
 
    // Open our own binary and print out first 4 bytes (which is the same
    // for all Mach-O binaries on a given architecture)
    int fd = open(argv[0], O_RDONLY);
    uint32_t magic_number = 0;
    read(fd, &magic_number, 4);
    printf("Mach-O Magic Number: %x \n", magic_number);
    close(fd);
 
    return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([AppDelegate class]));
  }
}
```
### Sample output
```
Calling real open('/var/mobile/Applications/161DA598-5B83-41F5-8A44-675491AF6A2C/Test.app/Test', 0)
Mach-O Magic Number: feedface 
Calling real close(3)
...
```

## How it works

`dyld` binds lazy and non-lazy symbols by updating pointers in particular sections of the `__DATA` segment of a Mach-O binary. __fishhook__ re-binds these symbols by determining the locations to update for each of the symbol names passed to `rebind_symbols` and then writing out the corresponding replacements.

For a given image, the `__DATA` segment may contain two sections that are relevant for dynamic symbol bindings: `__nl_symbol_ptr` and `__la_symbol_ptr`. `__nl_symbol_ptr` is an array of pointers to non-lazily bound data (these are bound at the time a library is loaded) and `__la_symbol_ptr` is an array of pointers to imported functions that is generally filled by a routine called `dyld_stub_binder` during the first call to that symbol (it's also possible to tell `dyld` to bind these at launch). In order to find the name of the symbol that corresponds to a particular location in one of these sections, we have to jump through several layers of indirection. For the two relevant sections, the section headers (`struct section`s from `<mach-o/loader.h>`) provide an offset (in the `reserved1` field) into what is known as the indirect symbol table. The indirect symbol table, which is located in the `__LINKEDIT` segment of the binary, is just an array of indexes into the symbol table (also in `__LINKEDIT`) whose order is identical to that of the pointers in the non-lazy and lazy symbol sections. So, given `struct section nl_symbol_ptr`, the corresponding index in the symbol table of the first address in that section is `indirect_symbol_table[nl_symbol_ptr->reserved1]`. The symbol table itself is an array of `struct nlist`s (see `<mach-o/nlist.h>`), and each `nlist` contains an index into the string table in `__LINKEDIT` which where the actual symbol names are stored. So, for each pointer `__nl_symbol_ptr` and `__la_symbol_ptr`, we are able to find the corresponding symbol and then the corresponding string to compare against the requested symbol names, and if there is a match, we replace the pointer in the section with the replacement.

The process of looking up the name of a given entry in the lazy or non-lazy pointer tables looks like this:
